		      <p>This is a machine learning project that I did with my team at school. We pulled around 1000 songs from 2014 using Spotify’s online database. Then we tried to predict if a song would be in the Top 100 songs for that year. We used Weka for the machine learning algorithms. We used the j48 decision tree as it gave us the best f1 measure and highest accuracy of correctly classified instances.

		      <p>This is an app that I developed for the Pebble smart watch at HackIllinois with my team. BuzzKill detects what website you are visiting on your laptop, checks whether it is a time-wasting website that you blacklisted (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc.), and if it is, starts a timer on the Pebble that tracks how long you stay on the website. Additionally, the Pebble vibrates every 15 seconds to remind you that you are still on that time wasting site. When you leave the time wasting site the timer and incessant buzzing stop. The app was coded in C using the online Pebble SDK. The app interfaces with the user’s laptop through a Chrome extension. The Chrome extension is coded in Javascript. The user can edit the app’s settings (blacklisted sites, buzzer time interval, etc.) through the Chrome extension. Firebase was used as the database.

		      <p>This is a virtual beer pong game that my team and I made at MadHacks. We developed the game for the Leap Motion sensor using the Unity Game engine with C#. The Leap sensor detects the user’s hand. The user can simulate picking up and throwing a pong ball and then you can see it flying into a cup on the screen. We developed a singleplayer and multiplayer version of the game.

		      <p>This was the first Android application that I developed at WildHacks 2014. Simon helps you make decisions. You can type in a list of options and Simon will choose the right one for you. You add options by pressing the + button and you can delete options by pressing the – button. When you have finished entering your options press the S or Simon button for an answer. Simon tells you which option he thinks is best. This was my first hackathon project. I learnt how to develop for Android.</p>
